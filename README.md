How it Works
The system uses historical gold price data and various machine learning models to predict the future trend of gold prices.

Data Collection: The project collects historical gold price data from various sources like APIs or CSV files.
Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and normalized for better accuracy in predictions.
Feature Engineering: Various features, such as moving averages, volatility, and market trends, are created for better predictions.
Model Training: Different machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM networks) are trained on the historical data.
Prediction: The trained model predicts future gold prices and trends based on the input data.
Models Used
This project implements various machine learning models for prediction:

Linear Regression - Simple model for trend forecasting.
Random Forest - Used for decision tree-based predictions.
XGBoost - Gradient boosting algorithm for higher accuracy.
LSTM Neural Networks - Deep learning-based approach to predict future prices.
